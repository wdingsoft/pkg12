Crux Simplex   

Crux simplex
Drawing by Justus Lipsius
(1547 - 1606)
The Crux Simplex or Stipe, being a simple upright post, does not have the transverse beam found on other forms. The ancient Greek word for stake is stauros (n) and stauroo (v).

This simple post was common for crucifixions until the Phoenicians added a cross beam.
