The swastika
  
 The swastika can be simply described as an equilateral cross with the arms bended at right angles. Even before Adolf Hitler was born, the swastika was already used in Indo-European cultures in the Neolithic ages. It was used to connote good fortune or luck and is still considered one of the sacred symbols of Hinduism and Buddhism. 

Of course, most of us consider this as a fearsome symbol because Hitler used the swastika as his own insignia when he ordered the mass murder of millions of Jews and the death in war of tens of millions people world wide.
