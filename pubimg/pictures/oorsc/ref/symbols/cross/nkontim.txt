Nkontim Symbol

A symbol with similar characteristics, though completely unrelated to the Basque Cross, is the African Nkontim. (Coincidentally, however, just as the word lau-buru is associated with mountains, there is a hill in Cameroon called Nkontim.)

The symbol's hairy and industrious image gives a clue to its meaning:

•Nkontim is an Adinkra (West African) symbol meaning 'loyalty and readiness to serve'. (See www.mycustomstationery.com/resources/adinkra/)
•Nkontim in English is 'Hair of the queen's servant'. Not an everyday word, of course, but keeping traditional cultures alive is good for everyone. English and French are the most widely spoken languages in the area.
The symbol can be seen painted on the shells of African drums sold to tourists.
