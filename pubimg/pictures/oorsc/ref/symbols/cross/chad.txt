St. Chad's Cross on top of the Chapel of Industry in Coventry Cathedral
The cross is a combination of a Potent Cross and Quadrate Cross, which appears in the arms of the episcopal see of Lichfield & Coventry.

St. Ceadda was from Northumbria, England and in 664 became the Abbot of Lastingham, North Yorkshire. Later, he became Bishop of York and then Lichfield. He died three years later in 672.

It is from Lichfield that we get the design of the St. Chad's Cross. (You can read much more about St. Chad from the Lichfield Parish Church website: www.saintchads.org.uk)
