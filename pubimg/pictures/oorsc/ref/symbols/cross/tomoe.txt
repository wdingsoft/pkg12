Daikoku

Daikoku (or Daikokuten)
Daikoku came to Japan from China in the 9th century, although originally he was an incarnation of Shivain in India, where he protected people against evil forces. In addition to giving a good harvest to farmers, he is another god that ensures prosperity and wealth in commerce and trade. He is also guardian for cooks and all kitchen workers. People who dream of financial riches tend to worship this god.

Daikoku wears ancient courtly hunting clothing with a hood or bonnet. He stands or sits on bulging rice bales and his portly belly implies he's well-fed and prosperous. In the sack slung over his left shoulder, he carries treasure. Exactly what type of treasure is unclear - perhaps it's the great treasure of wisdom and patience. In the old days, 'treasure' might have been sufficient rice to overcome hunger. These days it may be a huge pile of cash, or the ultimate treasure - free time!

In his right hand he holds a lucky wooden mallet (uchide-no-kozuchi) that dispenses good fortune whenever he strikes it. Daikoku is the father of Ebisu and they are often depicted together in carvings and paintings.

The mallet often has the auspicious tomoe motif. In Japan both the Tomoe and the related Triquetra are used as a kamon; a sort of heraldic coat of arms (ka means 'family' and mon means 'crest'). Like the cross in European heraldry, kamon were used especially in battle to identify individuals or members of a clan. They were first owned by the aristocracy and later rolled out to anyone associated with that community. Kamon are still used by Japanese, especially as decorations on their formal kimono.
