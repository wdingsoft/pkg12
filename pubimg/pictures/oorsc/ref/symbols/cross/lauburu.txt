Basque Cross 
(Lauburu)
The Basque Cross shape is called a Lauburu, an ancient symbol of prosperity. In the Basque language lau-buru means 'four mountain peaks' ('four heads' or 'four tips') and it is possible this term gave rise to the name of Labarum.

In the Basque Country, the symbol became popular in the 16th century art either as a representation of the four medieval regions (Araba, Biscay, Gipuzkoa and Navarre) or as a Christian Cross (following the Reconquista). The symbol does not appear on the Basque Flag or any of the coats-of-arms of the seven regions (Álava, Bizkaia, Guipúzcoa, Navarra, Behe Nafarroa, Lapurdi and Zuberoa).
