Description:
This oracle bone was unearthed from the lower cultural stratum of the Ch’eng-tzu-yai site, and clearly belonged to the Lung-shan culture. There are two differences between oracle bones of the Lung-shan period and those of the Shang dynasty. The Lung-shan oracle bones show no signs of systematic T-shaped drilling used to control the crack-signs and contain no inscriptions. The oracle bone is used for divination and reveals aspects of the spiritual life of the Lung-shan culture.
