This cow scapula (shoulder blade) has 40 circular holes, which were probably drilled as some kind of tally system. "Oracle" bones were among the implements a shaman might use. They could be scorched, causing the surface to craze in ways that could be read for divination. From the Iron Period site of Zhangdi Yingzi, Aihui District, Heihe.
