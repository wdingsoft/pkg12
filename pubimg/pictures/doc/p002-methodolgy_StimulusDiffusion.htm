			Stimulus Diffusion Theory</h3>
		<p>
			Stimulus diffusion was first proposed by Kroeber in 1940. Although it was initially limited in the discussion of the concrete or specific elements for culture materials in certain areas within certain times, like porcelain, alphabets, Japanese furniture, Chinese drama etc, following evidences especially those achieved recently suggest that it could be extended for world culture research and especially in our OBI study.</p>

				The discovery of whole elegant chariots in Anyang in 1953[] provided unarguable solid evidence that the vehicles were undividable part of all earliest cultures. The world wide popularity of vehicles in ancient time made it possible for telecommunication among them. With the carriage unearthed in Anyang in Shang dynasty, driven by a slow horse that walks 30 mile a day with 200 days a year, it only took about one year for people to travel from central China to Iraq, and couple of years for a round trip with the help of well guidance. (see map)</li>
			<li>
				Among all unearthed oracle bones, the large mount of heterogeneous spices of turtle shells, some of them were imported thousands miles away from Malay Peninsular, centralized in Shang dynasty at Anyang also has exhibited the development level of transportation at that times. (See table)</li>
			<li>
				Through the study of about 400 full body human skulls unearthed from the Shang sites at Anyang, the scholars tell us that the population in ancient Shang had considerable variation with majority of Mongoloid type and minority of possible of Caucasoid and Oceanic Negroids, although the racial relationship and the immigration motivation were still unclear so far. [Coon Li Chi]. Today we can still see great similarities between Chinese and Mongolia in race. It is reasonable to deduct that original Chinese came from a tribe of Mongolia which could explain why Mongolia always invade china again and again for thousands of years. The great wall which started build since Qing (25BC) is nothing but a historic proclaim of independence and separation from Mongolian.� Since then, Chinese people began to call himself as Han which is the majority of today�s Chinese and the chinese characters are called Hanzi.</li>
			<li>
				The most influential classic philosophers, suddenly emerged globally within short time from about 600 BC to 200 BC, inferred that the internal kernel of different civilizations caused by scattered distribution of territory are actually synchronous in time domain, although their ways, the view points, the styles, the writings, the focused disciplines and so on were quite different.</li>
			<li>
				Through out the world wide early human culture development in archeology, we can find that there exists a proportional relationship between the geographical distance and chronic age of matured civilization relative to the oldest culture. For any matured ancient culture discovered by archeologists, the ratio of its direct distance to the time delay relative to the oldest culture place we found is roughly kept in a constant of about 1.7 mi/year ( = 0.0023 mile per second, which is the speed of snail). (See table) This value can also be confirmed by the statistic estimation of earliest discovery of bronzes, chariots and writing system sudden emerge locally. (see table )</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			All of these samples demonstrates that, although there were a huge diversity and capricious developments isolated by the geographic, there was no spiritual isolation among earliest different civilizations in ancient times, which undermined the theory that ancient developed Chinese culture was the results of thousands years of purely independent civilization evolution, that is supported by many Chinese scholars. It enhanced the stimulus diffusion theory and the constant spread speed could be considered as the stimulus diffusion rate at ancient times, a mathematical quantity expression for stimulus diffusion.</p>
		<p>
			Certainly the stimulus diffusion rate is none linear in long history due to the technology development. The stimulus diffusion rate at horse driven vehicle times certainly can not catch up the speed of light with the broadband internet based telecommunication.</p>
		<p>
			The stimulus diffusion theory can suggest that all cultures in the world are result of spread from one unique earliest origin although their styles or species are quite different and there exist a fundamental common in kernel concept among all cultures.</p>
		<p>
			The stimulus diffusion theory can also tell us that Shang culture is closely related and undividable part of world human culture. In other words, to understand the ancient culture outside of china, can help us to better understand the Shang culture. In reverse, to understand Shang culture can also help us to better understand the culture of world in other areas. They can contrast to each other and provide evidence to support each other. This led us to propose a new method called biblical evidence method.</p>
